> :fire: [What's new in Playwright-BDD v8](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/blog/whats-new-in-v8)

## Why Playwright runner?
Both [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [CucumberJS](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) have their own test runners. 
You can use CucumberJS runner with [Playwright as a library](https://playwright.dev/docs/library) to test BDD scenarios.
This package offers **an alternative way**: convert BDD scenarios into Playwright test files and run them with Playwright runner. Such approach brings all the benefits of Playwright runner:

* Automatic browser initialization and cleanup
* Auto-capture of screenshots, videos and traces
* Parallelization with sharding
* Auto-waiting of page elements
* Out-of-box visual comparison testing
* Power of Playwright fixtures
* [...a lot more](https://playwright.dev/docs/library#key-differences)

## Extras
Some features were developed in Playwright-BDD on top of Playwright and BDD approaches:

* üî• Advanced tagging [by path](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-features/tags-from-path) and [special tags](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-features/special-tags)
* üé© [Step decorators](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-steps/decorators) for class methods
* üéØ [Scoped step definitions](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-steps/scoped)
* ‚ú® [Export steps](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-features/chatgpt) for AI
* ‚ôªÔ∏è [Re-using step functions](https://vitalets.github.io/playwright-bdd/#/writing-steps/reusing-step-fn)
