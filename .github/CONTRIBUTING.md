    ```
2. Install Playwright browsers:
    ```sh
    npx playwright install chromium
    ```
3. Run tests:
    ```sh
    npm t
    # run specific test
    npm run only test/<test-name-in-directory>
    ```
4. Run examples:
    ```sh

    # run specific example

## Useful Dev Commands

### Run a Single Test 
Use the command below (use TAB after typing `test/` to autocomplete the test path):
```
npm run only test/<%test-dir%>
```
Example:
```
npm run only test/special-tags
```

### Switch Playwright Version

```
npm run pw:browsers
```

```

### Clear Playwright Compilation Cache
```
npx playwright clear-cache
```
