    npm run build
    ```
4. Run tests:

## Useful Dev Commands

### Run a Single Test 
Use the command below (use TAB after typing `test/` to autocomplete the test path):
```
npm run only test/<%test-dir%>
```
Example:
```
npm run only test/special-tags
```

### Switch Playwright Version

```
npm run pw:browsers
```

npm show @playwright/test@1 deprecated
```

### Clear Playwright Compilation Cache
```
npx playwright clear-cache
```
