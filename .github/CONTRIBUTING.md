## Development setup

1. Navigate to the Playwright-BDD root directory:
    ```sh
    cd playwright-bdd
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Install Playwright browsers:
    ```sh
    npx playwright install chromium
    ```
4. Build project:
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
5. Run tests:
    ```sh
    npm t

    # run specific test
    npm run only test/<test-name-in-directory>
    ```
6. Run examples:
    ```sh
    npm run examples

    # run specific example
    npm run examples examples/<example-name-in-directory>
    ```
    Note: you may need to run `npm run examples` before commiting, as some pre-commit checks rely on its generated output.

## Useful dev commands

### Run a single test 
Use the command below (use TAB after typing `test/` to autocomplete the test path):
```
npm run only test/TEST_DIR_NAME
```
Example:
```
npm run only test/special-tags
```

```
npm run pw:browsers
```

```
npm show @playwright/test@1 deprecated
```

### Clear Playwright compilation cache
```
npx playwright clear-cache
```
