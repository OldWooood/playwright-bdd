# Playwright-BDD Code of Conduct

Welcome to the Playwright-BDD community! We’re here to make BDD testing awesome together. To keep this space friendly, inclusive, and productive, here’s what we expect from everyone:

## Be Respectful
Treat everyone with respect and kindness. Disagreeing is fine, but personal attacks, harassment, or offensive comments are not.

## Be Inclusive
We welcome contributors from all backgrounds. Keep language and content appropriate for a diverse audience.

## Be Constructive
Share ideas, feedback, and code that make the project better. If you’re raising an issue or submitting a pull request, be clear and helpful.

## No Spam or Self-Promotion
Keep discussions focused on Playwright-BDD. Excessive self-promotion or irrelevant content isn’t cool.

## Speak Up
If you see something that doesn’t align with this Code of Conduct, let us know. You can contact the project maintainers privately via email or GitHub.

## Consequences
Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from the community, depending on the situation.

Let’s build something great together!
